To run code, type in make or make all in command line, which will in turn compile math.c
into an executable. Then type ./math with mutually exclusive arguments -s to run sin test,
-c to run cos test, -t to run tan test, -e to run exp test, or -a to run all tests. Program
will only accept first argument and run its respective test. math.c will then display the
appropriate test and exit. Use make clean to clean up files produced when running make
or make all. No errors were generated when using make infer.
