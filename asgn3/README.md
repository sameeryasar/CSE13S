In order to run tower.c, type make or make all to compile code. To run the game, 
type ./tower with -s to run stack implementation of Towers of Hanoi or -r to run
recursive implementation. You can also use -n with a number as an argument to
set the number of discs, otherwise it will run either implementation with the
default 5. Hit enter after typing your arguments and tower.c will print your
desired implementations with each move and number of moves taken. Make infer
generates no errors.
