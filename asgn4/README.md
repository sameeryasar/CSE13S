To use the sequence program, type make or make all to compile corresponding files.
After compilation, type ./sequence and arguments -s to run a sequence test, -p to run
a palindrome test, or -n to set the largest number considered (default is 1000). Type
make clean afterwards to delete extra files.

No errors were created when running make infer.
