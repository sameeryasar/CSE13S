To use the program, type in make or make all, which will compile all the files
for hatterspeak. Then type ./hatterspeak to run the program and type in any words
to the terminal. The program will then return specific messages whether or not
you used forbidden oldspeak words or translatable oldspeak words. If you entered
hatterspeak words only, then the program will simply exit. Use arguments -s to 
supress the message and instead print statistics, -h to set the hash table size,
-f to set the bloom filter size, -m to set the move to front rule to true, or
-b to set the move to front rule to false. Do not use both -m and -b.

Make infer generated no errors.
